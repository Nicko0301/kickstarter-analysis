# Kickstarting with Excel
##OVERVIEW of Project
###PURPOSE
This project was designed to analyze Kickstarter data to help Louise fund her play.
##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data was filtered so as to contain only data pertaining to plays and their launch dates and outcomes.
![Outcomes based on Launch Date](kickstarter-analysis/Theater_Outcomes_by_Launch_Date)
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The number of successful, failed, and canceled plays were broken down by goal and the percentages of each were calculated.

###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The primary challenge was winnowing the data set, which was substantial, down to something more manageable and relevant to Louise's goals. This was accomplished by breaking down the data into subcategories and then applying a filter to select only plays. This subset was then broken down by outcome (successful, failed, canceled), funding goal, and launch date.
##Results
May and June had the highest number of successfully funded plays.
December had the fewest successfully funded plays.
Campaigns with funding goals of less than $5000 were the most successful.
